# Memora AI

An image database that uses the Google's Gemini AI to analyze your memes and make them searchable based on any text in the image and a set of tags the image is assigned.

### Features
- Metadata stored in a central json file for each database, avoiding the use of sidecar files.
- Search implemented with fuzzy token-matching, providing very high levels of recall.
- Counter to keep track of your daily gemini request limit.
- Option to manually add an image without the use of AI.
- Option to process large batches of images with a single click, without making more requests to the ai than your "per day" or "per minute" request limit.
- Option to have the AI reanalyze an image.
- Option to manually edit the image-text and tags generated by the AI.
